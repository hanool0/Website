            Today we faced a challenge in which we were using several pipes to transfer a marble down to a bucket on the floor. There were several rules like not letting the marble go backwards or not overlapping the pipes together so it is easier. In the beginning there were a lot of conversations to determine how we would arrange the pipes so the marble wouldn't move too fast and eventually drop on the floor. The marble still dropped on the floor so we kept coordinating our plans and eventually succeeded before the other team did. From this problem I learned an important lesson that conversing with your teammates and coming up with important strategies is a good way to succeed in something.

            Today we learned about the Rube Goldberg machine where you use the wheel and axle, pulley, lever, inclined plane, wedge, and screw. We used these ideas to create a machine in which the baseball would follow these mechanics and eventually make a needle pop a balloon. My group focused on a guillotine type of system in which the baseball would trigger a toy car to go down an inclined plane and trigger another pulley like system to cause a guillotine with a tungsten cube to go down on a balloon and pop it.

            Today we finished creating our Rube Goldberg Machine, The Tungsten Guillotine. Although the balloon we had to use was a water balloon which is smaller than the regular balloon, our project finished successfully and it turned out amazing. It felt really satisfying when the cube just dropped on the balloon. I think this project was really fun and helped me learn how important teamwork is and the creativity that is developed from the strong teamwork that was developed between our group.
