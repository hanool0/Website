            Today we faced a challenge in which we were using several pipes to transfer a marble down to a bucket on the floor. There were several rules like not letting the marble go backwards or not overlapping the pipes together so it is easier. In the beginning there were a lot of conversations to determine how we would arrange the pipes so the marble wouldn't move too fast and eventually drop on the floor. The marble still dropped on the floor so we kept coordinating our plans and eventually succeeded before the other team did. From this problem I learned an important lesson that conversing with your teammates and coming up with important strategies is a good way to succeed in something.

            Today we learned about the Rube Goldberg machine where you use the wheel and axle, pulley, lever, inclined plane, wedge, and screw. We used these ideas to create a machine in which the baseball would follow these mechanics and eventually make a needle pop a balloon. My group focused on a guillotine type of system in which the baseball would trigger a toy car to go down an inclined plane and trigger another pulley like system to cause a guillotine with a tungsten cube to go down on a balloon and pop it.

            Today we finished creating our Rube Goldberg Machine, The Tungsten Guillotine. Although the balloon we had to use was a water balloon which is smaller than the regular balloon, our project finished successfully and it turned out amazing. It felt really satisfying when the cube just dropped on the balloon. I think this project was really fun and helped me learn how important teamwork is and the creativity that is developed from the strong teamwork that was developed between our group. In the beginning we were having multiple conflicts considering whether or not we should buy a tungsten cube to actually make something like this, and we also was planning a different prototype to be used. However, with a lot of coordination, we were able to make a better prototype and it succeeded in helping us make the Tungsten Guillotine.

            Today Joseph and I dissected a desktop computer. We first took out the cover and continued on throughout the computer, identifying which parts or which parts and learn even more about computer engineering. Computer engineering is an interesting topic for me so I think I focused a bit more during this computer dissection as it was my first time dissecting one. We also had to identify which cables are connected to which so we also took a photo of that to keep track on what we are doing. When I saw the CPU I thought it looked really cool with the small pins and I also learned how delicate I have to be when handling a computer. I think this Computer Dissection was rather fun and I enjoyed the time I had when I did it. When we followed the step backwards to reorganize and put the parts back into the computer, we faced somewhat of a problem but we cooperated well and I believe that was important.

            Today Joshua and I were focusing on the bioengineering section of intro to engineering where we made a prosthetic hand. This was rather confusing in the beginning for me because I did not know how long the finger lengths should be nor how it would bend on will and grab an empty water bottle. However, Joshua had a great idea and we went to building the prosthetic hand. Our hand took longer to make than other groups and we also used a ton of duct tape. After making it we put rubber bands on both sides of the fingers so it can bend but we realized that would be a problem so we only put one rubber band on one side and use strings to tie the hand up and make it bend using a holder below the palm. I think this project was fun and required a lot of creativity which definitely piqued my interest for bioengineering.

            Today Joshua and I worked on the aerospace section of engineering. Our task for this section of engineering was to build a bottle rocket which was tested in the lower field to see who could launch it the furthest. Joshua and I forgot to bring a bottle to make the bottle rocket but thankfully Mr. Kim gave us a leftover coke bottle that we were able to use. We cut up small pieces of cardboard pieces into a rhombus shape and attached it to the bottom side of the rocket. We used larger triangles at the other end of the rocket to possibly make it penetrate through the air more and go further. However, when we tested it out, our plan did not go as expected and it instead flew sideways and go almost straight up.

            This week, Joshua and I indulged into the wonders of environmental engineering. This topic of engineering was quite a beauty and a wonderful thing to witness as it helped the environment strive and become a better area to live in. For our task, we were given dirt water and we were supposed to create a filter to clean out the water to make it cleaner than usual. Joshua and I used a double filter mechanic where we cleaned the water in the beginning by putting rocks and cotton balls and smaller rocks on the top. Then we shoved lots of cotton balls on the very bottom of our filter to double filter the water and make it cleaner. However, our plan did not work as planned, but it still made the water somewhat cleaner, which was part of the task. We learned a lot about the idea behind environmental engineering and how important it is in modern day society.

            Today we focused on a new engineering topic called electrical engineering where we focus on the appliances that rely on electricity. We used the tinkercad website to cad a design in which a battery powers an LED using resistors and negative and positive electrical conduction. It was kind of difficult but I think the cycle was pretty interesting.

            This week, Joshua and I furthered our progress on the idea of electrical engineering where we used diodes, resistors, and a breadboard to try powering the diode in multiple ways and also power multiple diodes at the same time. This time we used an arduino which is also known as a mini computer. We connected the arduino with a USB port to our computer and downloaded a compiler that ran commands and helped the diode either blink then pause or even make the light fade. It was pretty cool but there were some difficulties due to the fact that we couldn't download the arduino compiler for some reason but also when placing the diodes and resistors on the breadboard. I learned that electrical engihneering is not as simple and easy as it sounds and requires resilience with your partner to solve the problems that are discovered.

            This week, we learned about Business Engineering and the marketting behind everything. We watched a SharkTank video and we were tasked to work and pitch an idea like SharkTank. Instead of working with Joshua, I worked with Joseph this week. In the beginning we had absolutely no idea as to what pitch idea to come up with. However, we decided to come up with an app called PenShift. This app converts illegible hand writing into text and helps in reading. This was a cool idea because many people like teachers or patients in hospitals need it especially when you try to identify what your doctor is prescribing you or what you are symptomed with. It was a fun project and we presented in the class, but there were some stupid questions that people were asking.
